# CODECLAUSEINTERNSHIP-Natural-Language-Processing-for-Legal-Documents

🧠 Legal Document Summarization using NLP


🔰 Golden Level Project – CodeClause Internship


This project demonstrates the use of advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to extract and summarize key points from legal documents. Using tools like spaCy and Hugging Face's Transformers, the system processes unstructured legal text and returns a concise summary, making it easier to understand lengthy and complex legal agreements.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a system that can:

Read and process legal documents from .txt files.

Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) to highlight important legal terms, names, dates, etc.

Generate an intelligent summary of the document using Transformer models.

## 🔍 Technologies Used

Python

spaCy (for Named Entity Recognition)

Hugging Face Transformers (for text summarization)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development)

## 📂 Files Included

legal_document_summarization.ipynb → Full Jupyter Notebook containing code, processing steps, and summary output.

sample_legal.txt → Sample legal document used as input.

README.md → This documentation file.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Load the Legal Document
Reads the content from a .txt file containing the legal text.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Uses spaCy to detect key entities like names, organizations, locations, money amounts, etc.

Summarization using Transformers
Applies a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face to generate a summary of the entire legal text.

Display the Summary
Shows both extracted entities and the final condensed version of the document.

## ✅ Sample Output

📄 Original Document: Sample legal agreement containing 70+ words
✨ Entities Found: Organization Names, Dates, Legal Terms


## 💡 Use Cases

LegalTech document analysis

Contract summarization

Legal compliance reviews

Policy understanding for non-lawyers
